# *(fork of)* Penn State Communities Index

![PSCI Banner](github.png)

The **Penn State Communities Index** is an unofficial initiative aimed at fostering community and connection among Penn State students. This lightweight and efficient project provides a centralized platform to discover and join various group chats (GCs) for different interests, classes, and communities within Penn State.

## Why did I make this fork?

Becasue **[XelXen](https://github.com/XelXen)** loves blinding people.
